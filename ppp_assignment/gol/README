MPI assignment for the Parallel Programming Practical (PPP)

Content:

- gol
	Contains sequential version of the Game of Life algorithm
		Create parallel version of the Game of Life algorithm there 
		and name it gol-par.

- docs
	Place there your report.

- bin	
	Contains sample gol-sanity-check (comparison with expected output)
		Do not submit programs which do not go through sanity-checks successfully.
		Your parallel implementation should give identical output to the sequential one,
		also for versions that print world states and intermediate live cells counts.
		Only the output on standard error showing the timing information will change.
		You can make additional sanity checks of your own based on this.
